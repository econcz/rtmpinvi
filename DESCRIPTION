Description: Provides an interactive wrapper for the 'tmpinv()' function from
    the 'rtmpinv' package with options extending its functionality to pre-
    and post-estimation processing and streamlined incorporation of prior cell
    information. The Tabular Matrix Problems via Pseudoinverse Estimation
    (TMPinv) is a two-stage estimation method that reformulates structured
    table-based systems - such as allocation problems, transaction matrices,
    and input-output tables - as structured least-squares problems. Based
    on the Convex Least Squares Programming (CLSP) framework, TMPinv solves
    systems with row and column constraints, block structure, and optionally
    reduced dimensionality by (1) constructing a canonical constraint form
    and applying a pseudoinverse-based projection, followed by (2) a
    convex-programming refinement stage to improve fit, coherence, and
    regularization (e.g., via Lasso, Ridge, or Elastic Net).
